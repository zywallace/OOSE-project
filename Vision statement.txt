One of key missing features of today’s appointment systems is that patient lack of the knowledge to choose department based on symptoms barely. They might even go to the wrong department and waste their time and money. Besides, phone call or in person are still the main method of requesting an appointment while more people consider it would be a great idea to manage their appointments online and keep the track of health records.Our project will be a web app that supports both patient and physicians to login and manage their appointments, as one of our core functions. For patient, they can also:1.update their personal information2.request an appointment with their preferences3.monitor their medical record4.maintain health graphically5.send message to their physicians. Physicians in turn could get patients’ information beforehand to get them better prepared.In order to give primary suggestions before the first visit, patients would give their description of symptoms in either natural language or select menu, instead of choosing department or doctors directly. Systems then should map the symptoms to possible causes using vector space model and list physicians specializing in that area to let patient browse freely. The next step is to request an appointment with desired physicians at preferred time slots. If requirements could not be met, other available appointment with different time or physicians would be displayed. Patients should be able to make an appointment in an old fashioned way as well.The backend of the website will be built up using Spring and Hibernate, while the front end GUI will be written in HTML5 and JavaScript.
